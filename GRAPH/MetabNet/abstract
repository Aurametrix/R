MetabNet: an R package for metabolic association analysis of high-resolution metabolomics data. Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 3:87. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2015.00087

Liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry provides capability to measure >40,000 ions derived from metabolites in biologic samples. This presents challenges to confirm identities of known chemicals and delineate potential metabolic pathway associations of unidentified chemicals. We provide an R package for metabolic network analysis, MetabNet, to perform targeted metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) of specific metabolites to facilitate detection of their related metabolic pathways and network structures.
