# the complexity of PCA for  n data points, each represented with p features comes from
# covariance matrix computation: O(p2n) and eigen-value decomposition ]: O(p3) => O(p2n+p3).
# O(min(p^3,n^3));  SVD: O(4m2n + 8mn2 + 9n3)
# computing the SVD of a mxn matrix immediately yields its PCA
# the complexity of SVD for mâˆ—n matrix is (m*n^2 + n^3)
## 1st step: O(mn2) floating-point operations for reducing the matrix to a bidiagonal one
## 2nd step: SVD itself costs O(n) flops

# simple implementation of randomized SVD in R
